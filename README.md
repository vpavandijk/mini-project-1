#UPDATE JULY 2020:
This was my very first python coding. We did this when we were three days into the bootcamp.

## Project Description
Of the available options I chose to build blackjack because that is a game we always played at home in the days I was young. I also right away had an idea how to do it.

## Rules
- Dealer gives around cards.
- Player plays first (hit or pass), after hit bust is an option as well.
- Only when player passes, dealer plays according to specific rules (when to hit himself and when to stop).

## Workflow
- I first wrote down on paper (on high level) which steps to take, these were:
	- initialise a deck of cards
	- build a function to value the cards
	- give cards to player and dealer (dealer has one closed)
	- let the player play
	- let the dealer play (if player does pass)
	- show if player has won or lost
- During building I did get stuck a few times (used google to find answers)
- During building I also thought of a lot of improvements, which I noted in the Jupiter notebook file (some I could make right away, others are for later)

## Organization
Only wrote down high level steps, then started coding.
